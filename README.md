# Advanced-CSS--Challenge-2
## Portfolio that showcases applications which demonstrate the necessary skills to execute certain functionalities of each design.
### This challenge from the UT bootcamp was intended to test my knowledge of HTML and CSS, I created a portfolio website from scratch to showcase my current and future applications. This website also includes links for potential employers to easily access my code repositories as well as contact information.

The challenge required me to create an aesthetically pleasing design with easy navigation for the user. My goal was to utilize HTML and CSS to create a responsive website that works well on mobile devices as well as desktop computers.

In order to complete this challenge I wrote semantic HTML with clean markup which is essential for accessibility and SEO purposes, included CSS styles that improved my design layout and gave me more control over the visuals of my portfolio. I also utilized media queries to ensure the website displayed correctly on both mobile and desktop devices.

Overall, this challenge has given me an understanding of how all these technologies work together to produce user friendly website. Check in throughout the future to see more completed projects to come and watch the overall site change as I add more features.
